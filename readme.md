<h4>Hydrocarbon scripts</h4>
Two octave scripts dealing with flow of hydrocarbons, which can not be handled with ordinary equatations.</p>
All units are in US Customary System - those are units which Oil industry is using.</p>
<h5> MIT.m</h5>
Calculates pressure losses in pipeline due to friction, using MIT equatation for crude oil.</p>
**Note:** do not use "dummy" data as Reynolds number may become negative and break further calculation.</p>
<h5>Miller.m</h5>
Script calculates Volumetric Flow of light hydrocarbons through pipeline, based on pressure drop. Do not use it as replacement for flowmeter, but more as <u>supplement</u> if flowmeter giving "strange" redings. Yap, flowmeters "health" depends on fluid filtration.</p>

**NOTE:** use scripts on **your own risks**. Scripts will not break your computer, but if that happens do not contact me. No **any kind of warranty!** </p>
